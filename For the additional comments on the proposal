"This year’s US State of Cybercrime
survey revealed a significant correlation
between the level of spending on
cybersecurity and the number of events
detected. In other words, the more you
spend, the more incidents you
will detect.
Consider, for instance, the generalization
that organizations operating in highly
regulated sectors typically have high-
performing cybersecurity programs.
They also invest considerably more in
cybersecurity than organizations from
other sectors. This year, banking and
finance respondents spent as much as
$2,500 per employee (median) on
cybersecurity, while retail and consumer
products businesses invested up to $400
per employee (median) and education
respondents invested a maximum of
$200 per employee (median). "
"Companies without security training for
new hires reported average annual
financial losses of $683,000, while those
do have training said their average
financial losses totaled $162,000. "
